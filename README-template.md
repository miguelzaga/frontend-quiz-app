## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select a quiz subject
- Select a single answer from each question from a choice of four
- See an error message when trying to submit an answer without making a selection
- See if they have made a correct or incorrect choice when they submit an answer
- Move on to the next question after seeing the question result
- See a completed state with the score after the final question
- Play again to choose another subject
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the entire app only using their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Change the app's theme between light and dark

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Font Variation Settings vs Weight](https://g.co/gemini/share/625694e0bd73) & [Variable fonts guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts/Variable_fonts_guide) - I used them to clear my doubts about importing a variable font with different styles. I ended up declaring two font weight for regular and italics. Then I would change the font-weight with the classes 'font-thin' and 'font-regular'.

- [width](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width) - I customized the class that applies the max width to the container for the whole page. I would usually use a custom value, but this alternative is nice.

- [PX to REM converter](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - I just use it instead of calculating it. It also has a useful table.

- [Detecting classes in source files](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/detecting-classes-in-source-files) - If we are using tailwind classes in a dynamic way, it is very important to add the complete so that the CSS is actually shipped.


- [Index type troubleshooting with Grok](https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_e655014b-c511-4abf-80f3-0fc66ee299eb) - I did not know about index types. I had to create one for an object for the colors of the list elements in the start menu. 
```ts
  interface StringDictionary {
    [key: string]: string;
  }
```

- [Index Signatures](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/type-system/index-signatures) - I had many doubts about index signatures from Grok's answer. This Documentation is great. I do not fully grasp the concept, but know I have some familiarity.

- [React Image Loading from JSON](https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_f00cb14f-ae2f-4d9d-a7be-c8efbacb46d6) - I did not want to import each List image manually, I wanted the component to be dynamic if a new topic would be added to the app. Using Vite, Grok suggested to import it with `import.meta.glob`

- [Vite Features - Glob Import](https://vite.dev/guide/features#glob-import) - This the feature suggested by Grok. I think is pretty cool. I actually changed how all my svg were being imported. I struggled typing the object but it was done.

- [React - Passing JSX as children](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#passing-jsx-as-children) - I made the Option component more reusable, for the start menu and the questions. 

- [Dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) & [Grok conversation](https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_74a61df4-e072-48bb-b9c7-6c86ef3db8df) - It was super useful to get the dark mode functionality.
